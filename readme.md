# string calculator

This is a calculator app (library) that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two numbers. 
 We used the find method of std::string and the standard numeric conversion functions.  The app accepts integers and floating-point numbers.
 
 This is just an experiment on using different utilities like `std::variants`, `std::tuple` and `std::any`. As an approach, it is not guaranteed to be the most efficient.
